# FlexNav
## Project has been put on hold.

## What is it?
FlexNav is a fixed responsive navbar made with flexbox. Its purpose is to be easy to add to your site, simply by copying the css file and the html navigation. It's also made to be lightweight, meaning no jQuery or other unnecessary stuff. I created this navbar for my own use so that I didn't have to go through the pain of making a new responsive navbar for every site.

## How do I use it?
It's really simple to get started, all you need to do is to copy the **flexnav.css** and **script.js** file and put it into your own site. After that you copy this HTML:
```
<div id="nav-background">
  <div id="nav-container">
    <header id="nav-header">
      <h1><a href="#" id="nav-logo">FlexNav</a></h1>
      <div id="nav-menu-button">MENU</div>
    </header>
    <nav>
      <ul class="nav-ul hide-ul">
        <li><a class="nav-link active-link" href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a class="nav-link" href="#">News</a></li>
        <li><a class="nav-link" href="#">Contact</a></li>
        <li><a class="nav-link" href="#">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </div>
</div>
```
and put it at the top of your body section.

## How does it work?
The navigation is based on a few different layers.

#### nav-background
This is the white background of the nav that spans across the whole width of the page. It encapsulates the whole navigation.

#### nav-container
I use this part to switch between ```column``` and ```row``` when displaying the navbar on different screen sizes. Column for mobiles, row for desktops. It's also where the width of the navbar is set. Right now the max-width of the navbar is 1000px, but this can be changed of course to fit your needs.

#### nav-header
This is where the logo (right now it's just text) is located.

#### nav-ul and hide-ul
```nav-ul``` adds styling to the navigation items while ```hide-ul``` toggles the mobile menu on and off if you click the menu button.

## What will change?
This navigation is a work in progress and there's still a lot of things to iron out. I still haven't done much testing of how it actually works when implementing it on a variety of sites, so use with caution. My plan is to keep making it more stable and efficient until it will be an easy Plug & Play menu usable on all sites. I'm also planning on making it easy to change the styling of the menu.
